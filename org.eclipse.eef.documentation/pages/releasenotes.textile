h2. Release Notes for Eclipse EEF

{toc:style=disc|minLevel=2|maxLevel=3}

This document contains the release notes for recent major releases of EEF.

h3(#eef2.0.1). Changes in EEF 2.0.1

h4. User-Visible Changes

* <span class="label label-success">Added</span> A conflict resolution policy has been added to the Text widget. The implementation of the text widget now uses a new preference TEXT_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_MODE, which is not exposed in the UI but can be configured programmatically using EEFPreferences.setTextConflictResolutionMode(). The default preference value can also be overridden by configuration, using the -pluginCustomization startup flag to point to a plugin_customization.ini file with, for example: org.eclipse.eef.ide.ui/TEXT_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_MODE=USE_LOCAL_VERSION. EEFTextLifecycleManager supports three modes. First, USE_MODEL_VERSION which will overwrite the widget's content with the value computed from the new version of the model (no user feedback). This is the default behavior. Second, USE_LOCAL_VERSION which will keep the current value begin edited by the end-user in the widget (no user feedback). Third, ASK_USER which will open a simple dialog box to ask the user which version to keep. Note that the simple dialog provided is only suitable for short (single-line) text fields.
* <span class="label label-info">Modified</span> Fix an issue with the refresh of list widgets
* <span class="label label-info">Modified</span> Fix an issue with the conditional style of the text widgets

h4. Developer-Visible Changes

* <span class="label label-success">Added</span> The text widget has been modified to add support for the customization of the conflict resolution policy. Conflict resolution can be customized by providing a custom LifecycleManager which extends the default EEFTextLifecycleManager and overrides either askUserToResolveConflict() to take the preference in consideration, but implement ASK_USER differently, for example with a more sophisticated dialog or resolveEditionConflict() to provide a completely different strategy (possibly ignoring the preference).

h3(#eef2.0.0). Changes in EEF 2.0.0

h4. Specifier-Visible Changes

* <span class="label label-success">Added</span> You can now create _Toolbar Actions_ on pages and groups in order to define small buttons in their toolbars.
* <span class="label label-success">Added</span> _Buttons_ and _Widget Actions_ can now use an image along with a label thanks to the new _Image expression_.
* <span class="label label-success">Added</span> It is now possible to execute some behavior when the end users will click on the _Reference Widget_ thanks to the addition of an _OnClick expression_.
* <span class="label label-success">Added</span> You can indicate that a _Dynamic Mapping For_ should force the refresh of the user interface with the _Force Refresh_ property.

h4. Developer-Visible Changes

* <span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The class @org.eclipse.eef.core.api.controllers.AbstractEEFController@ and all its subclasses now require an EditingContextAdapter.

h3(#eef1.9.2). Changes in EEF 1.9.2

* <span class="label label-success">Added</span> Widget actions are now available on labels and hyperlinks.
* <span class="label label-success">Added</span> Labels and hyperlinks now have a displayExpression. If unused, the result of the valueExpression will be converted to a string using the @java.lang.Object#toString()@ operation.

* <span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The constructor of the EEFLabelController now requires an EditingContextAdapter to run the expression of the widget actions.
* <span class="label label-success">Added</span> The class EEFStyleHelper is now API in order to help support style and conditional styles for custom widgets. Developers will need to override org.eclipse.eef.ide.ui.api.widgets.AbstractEEFWidgetLifecycleManager.getEEFStyleHelper() to provide their own implementation. The easiest way will need to extend the regular implementation and modify the three switchs to provide using the dedicated getters.
