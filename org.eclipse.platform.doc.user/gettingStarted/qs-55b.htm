<h1>Exiting the Workbench</h1>

<P CLASS="Para"> Each time the Workbench is exited, the Workbench is automatically 
  saved, including all open perspectives and windows. The next time the Workbench 
  is reopened, it will appear exactly as it was when it was last closed.</P>
<p> To exit the Workbench, select <b>File &gt; Exit</b> from the menu bar or close 
  the workbench with the window close button (x). When the latter option is used 
  a prompt will ask if you really wish to exit the workbench. </p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>This dialog also presents an option to turn off the 
  prompting. To turn it back on, select <strong>Window &gt; Preferences</strong> 
  from the main Workbench menu bar, in the Preferences Dialog select <strong>General 
  &gt; Startup and Shutdown</strong> and check Confirm exit when closing last 
  window.</p>
